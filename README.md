# Algorithms - MST
1. Receive data (number of vertices, number of edges, edges and their weight) and build a graph (DS) from it.
2. Check that the graph is both valid as per the data provided and connected.
3. Find the Minimal Spanning Tree using Prim Algorithm and return its weight.
4. Find the Minimal Spanning Tree using Kruskal Algorithm and return its weight.
5. Remove the last provided edge.
6. Find the Minimal Spanning Tree (if there is one) using Kruskal Algorithm and return its weight.
